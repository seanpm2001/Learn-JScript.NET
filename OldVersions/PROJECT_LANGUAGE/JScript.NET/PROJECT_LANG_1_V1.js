// About:
// I decided to make JScript.NET the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-JScript.NET) as JScript.NET is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the JScript.NET programming language. It only makes sense to JScript.NET the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
